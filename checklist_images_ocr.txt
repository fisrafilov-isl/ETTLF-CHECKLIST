Here is a detailed extraction of the data from the provided screenshots, organized for clarity and to help you identify items for your new TLF and E&T programme checklists.
Key Observations for Your Project

    Reusability is High: Most document submission items (passports, birth certificates, medical forms) are triggered by broad conditions like application status or enrollment year. These can likely be reused for your new programmes without modification.

    Critical IB Tracks Field: The system uses a field called IB Tracks to differentiate between programmes. You will see conditions like IB Tracks Does not equal IB: Technology Leaders Sch or IB Tracks Does not equal IB: Entrepreneurship & Technology. This is the key field you will need to use to make checklist items appear only for your new programmes.

    Dependencies are Common: Many items only appear after a previous item is completed (e.g., Completed Checklist contains Receive Decision from Admission Team). This creates a logical workflow for parents.

    OR Groups for Different Cohorts: The logic often uses OR to group conditions for different cohorts, such as new applicants for 2024-2025, new applicants for 2025-2026, or re-enrolling students (REE 2025-2026).
