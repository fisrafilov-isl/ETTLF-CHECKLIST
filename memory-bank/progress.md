# Progress: Implementation Status

## What Works

### Completed Components
1. **Basic Mermaid Flow Chart**: 
   - Initial admission flow diagram created in `tlf_et_admission_flow_merged.md`
   - Programme selection logic (TLF vs E&T) implemented
   - Boarding decision tree established
   - Basic vs Extended Learning Support form logic mapped

2. **Core Architecture Defined**:
   - Dynamic checklist approach confirmed
   - OpenApply platform capabilities researched and documented
   - Integration points with DocuSign established
   - Legal compliance framework for digital signatures designed

3. **Stakeholder Alignment**:
   - Key stakeholders identified and roles clarified
   - Initial requirements gathering completed
   - Communication channels with Ilya (admission manager) established

### Functional Elements
- **Programme Differentiation**: TLF vs E&T flows clearly separated where needed
- **Boarding Logic**: Day school vs boarding requirements properly branched
- **Nationality-Based Routing**: Cyprus/EU vs international student paths defined
- **Document Collection Strategy**: Core mandatory documents identified

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Development Tasks

#### 1. Enhanced Mermaid Chart (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Add Missing Elements**:
  - Criminal background check for visa documents
  - Swimming consent form
  - Sports participation consent
  - Detailed visa document breakdown
  - Timeline indicators for pending deadlines

- **Improve Visual Design**:
  - Better separation of complex decision trees
  - Consider multi-chart approach for readability
  - Add visual indicators for pending/unknown requirements

#### 2. Outstanding Form Specifications
- **Learning Support Form**: Detailed field breakdown needed from Anna
- **Swimming Consent**: Exact wording and legal requirements
- **Sports Participation**: Content specification and preference integration
- **Parental Consent**: Template development with legal review
- **Boarding Code of Conduct**: Format and signature requirements

#### 3. Visa Documentation System
- **Document List**: Awaiting official specifications from Nicos
- **Implementation Strategy**: Single vs multiple checklist items decision
- **Criminal Background Check**: Integration into visa requirements
- **Conditional Logic**: Nationality-based requirement routing

### Medium-Term Implementation

#### 1. OpenApply Configuration
- **Custom Forms**: Build all identified forms in OpenApply
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement dynamic checklist rules
- **Document Categories**: Set up proper file organization
- **Workflow Automation**: Configure status change triggers

#### 2. Integration Setup
- **DocuSign**: Enrollment contract workflow
- **Email Templates**: Automated notification system
- **User Interface**: Parent portal customization
- **Staff Dashboard**: Admin interface for application management

#### 3. Testing and Validation
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete flow validation
- **Legal Compliance**: Signature validity verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load and usability testing
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Final sign-off process

## Current Status

### Active Work Streams
1. **Chart Enhancement**: Updating mermaid diagram with new requirements
2. **Requirements Clarification**: Following up with stakeholders for missing details
3. **Timeline Management**: Tracking June 21st deadline for parent meeting

### Blocked Items
1. **Visa Documents**: Waiting for Nicos (June 21st deadline)
2. **Medical Forms**: Need Anna's input on Learning Support form details
3. **Boarding Requirements**: Head of Boarding starts July 1st
4. **Legal Templates**: Consent forms pending legal review (after June 21st)

### Risk Areas
1. **Timeline Pressure**: June 21st deadline approaching rapidly
2. **Complexity Management**: Chart becoming too complex for easy use
3. **Stakeholder Availability**: Key people not immediately available
4. **Integration Complexity**: OpenApply conditional logic limitations

## Success Metrics

### Completed Milestones
‚úÖ Initial flow diagram created
‚úÖ Stakeholder roles identified  
‚úÖ Core requirements documented
‚úÖ Platform capabilities assessed
‚úÖ Legal compliance framework designed

### Pending Milestones
üîÑ Enhanced mermaid chart with all requirements
‚è≥ Complete form specifications from stakeholders
‚è≥ Visa document list from Nicos
‚è≥ OpenApply implementation started
‚è≥ User testing completed
‚è≥ Final stakeholder approval

### Quality Indicators
- **User Experience**: Minimal form fatigue, clear progression
- **Completeness**: All required documents properly collected
- **Compliance**: Legal validity of all signatures maintained
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined process reducing manual intervention
- **Scalability**: System supports anticipated application volume

## Known Issues

### Current Challenges
1. **Information Gaps**: Several form specifications still undefined
2. **Timeline Constraints**: Tight deadline with multiple dependencies
3. **Visual Complexity**: Need to balance detail with usability
4. **Platform Limitations**: OpenApply conditional logic constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Approach**: Implement core functionality first, enhance later
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Proactive follow-up on pending requirements
- **Flexible Design**: Build system to accommodate late-arriving specifications
- **Backup Plans**: Manual processes for areas where automation is limited
