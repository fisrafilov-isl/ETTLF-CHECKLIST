# Product Context: OpenApply Checklist Experience

## Why This Project Exists

The Island Private School of Limassol is expanding their IB offerings to include specialized technology and entrepreneurship programmes. These new programmes have unique requirements that differ significantly from standard IB admissions:

### Problems Being Solved
1. **Complex Admission Requirements** - Different document requirements based on programme type, boarding status, and nationality
2. **Manual Process Inefficiencies** - Current reliance on email communication and manual tracking
3. **Compliance Challenges** - Need to maintain legal validity of digital signatures under Cyprus law
4. **User Experience Fragmentation** - Parents facing form fatigue due to unclear requirements

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Parents of prospective students applying for TLF/E&T programmes
- **Secondary**: Admission staff (Fazil, Ilya) managing the process
- **Tertiary**: Support staff (Anna, Nicos, Head of Boarding) providing specialized input

## How It Should Work
