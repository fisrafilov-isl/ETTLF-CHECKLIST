### Process Notes

- This represents the current flow in OpenApply
- Items appear simultaneously after ROI submission  
- No conditional logic is currently implemented
- The process is the same regardless of boarding status or nationality
- Future iterations will add conditional branching based on Registration of Interest responses

### Implementation Status

#### Current State
- **Simple Linear Flow**: All items appear after ROI submission
- **No Conditional Logic**: Same process for all programme types
- **Manual Processing**: School reviews applications individually

#### Future Enhancements
- **Conditional Checklist Items**: Based on programme selection and boarding status
- **Automated Routing**: Different flows for TLF vs E&T programmes
- **Dynamic Requirements**: Visa documents only for non-EU boarding students
